		<h1>Adding Named Navigation to a jQuery Cycle Gallery[~:1:~]</h1>

<p>This tutorial will show you how extend the basic functionality of the jQuery Cycle Plug-in using the pagerAnchorBuilder function. This will allow us to automatically create a new menu item for each slide – especially useful if you add more slides with a content management system (look out for a tutorial implementing this in Drupal!). You can check out a demo of this tutorial here.[~:4:~]</p>

<h2>HTML Structure[~:6:~]</h2>

<p>The HTML structure is very simple so I won’t go into too much detail. There is a wrapper div which contains multiple divs. Each of these child divs will become a slide for the plug-in. Each of these slides can contain anything – for our purposes we at least need a title to pull text from for the navigation. It is important to note that if you&#39;re using images you must specify a height and width value (more information on the issue). Here is the structure I’ve used in the demo[~:9:~]</p>
